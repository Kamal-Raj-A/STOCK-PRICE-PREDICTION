# üöÄ STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
Predict future stock prices based on historical data using a machine learning model built with Keras, and deploy it as a simple, user-friendly web application using Flask.

---
## üéØ Objective

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

* Gather historical stock market data (such as open, high, low, close, and volume).

* Clean, normalize, and prepare the data for model training.

2. Model Development:

* Build and train a deep learning model (using Keras, e.g., LSTM) to predict future stock prices.

* Tune model parameters to improve prediction accuracy and prevent overfitting.

3. Model Evaluation:

* Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on unseen test data.

* Use appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

4. Model Deployment:

* Save the trained model in an appropriate format (such as .h5).

* Develop a Flask web application to deploy the model for real-time predictions.

5. User Interface Design:

* Create a simple, user-friendly web interface for users to input stock details and view predictions.

* Visualize actual vs predicted prices using graphs or charts.

6. Real-World Usability:

* Provide an accessible tool for investors, traders, and learners to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
Make complex AI predictions accessible through a friendly web portal.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
1. Frontend:
  * HTML (structure of the web pages)
  * CSS (styling like colors, fonts, spacing)
  * Bootstrap (for quick, responsive design and nice-looking buttons, forms, and layouts)
2. Backend:
  * Flask - A lightweight Python web framework to handle routing, server-side logic, and API endpoints. It connected the frontend with the machine learning model.
  * Keras (TensorFlow backend) - Used to build, train, and load the deep learning model (like LSTM) for stock price predictions. The model was saved (e.g., as a .h5 file) and loaded during runtime for making predictions.
  * Python - All backend logic (data preprocessing, model loading, prediction generation) was written in Python
3. Database:
  * yfinance is a Python library that allows users to access real-time and historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance.
  * It simplifies fetching data such as stock prices, volumes, and financial indicators using simple Python code.
  * In this project, yfinance was used to: Retrieve live stock market data based on user input (e.g., stock ticker). Provide historical data for model prediction and visualization.

## ‚ú® Key Features
1. Real-Time Stock Data Fetching
  * Utilizes the yfinance library to fetch live and historical stock data from Yahoo Finance for any given stock ticker.
2. Deep Learning Model
  * Built with Keras (TensorFlow backend), the project uses a deep learning model (likely LSTM) to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
3. Prediction Interface
  * Allows users to input a stock ticker and get a future price prediction, which is displayed on the web interface.
4. Flask Web Application
  * Developed a user-friendly Flask web app where users can interact with the model, input stock tickers, and view predictions.
5. Data Visualization
  * The application presents predictions using Matplotlib or Plotly to visually compare actual vs predicted stock prices.
6. Simple and Intuitive User Interface
  * The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring that the app is responsive and easy to use.
7. Model Saving and Loading
  * The trained deep learning model is saved in a .h5 file format and can be reloaded for real-time predictions, reducing model retraining time.
8. Backend Logic for Predictions
  * The backend uses Python and Flask to handle all logic, including fetching data, processing user input, and running the model to generate predictions.
9. Scalability
  * The project is designed in a modular way, allowing for easy integration of additional stock analysis features or more complex models.
